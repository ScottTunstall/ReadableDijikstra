# ReadableDijkstra

Code to implement the Dijkstra "shortest path" algorithm. Plot twist: it's readable!!!

The example code for the algorithm I've seen on websites has been utterly crap. I wasted so much time looking at badly written code I decided to do something about it.

If this helps you in any way, drop me a line and let me know.
